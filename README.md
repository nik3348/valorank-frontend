# Valorank

Valorank is a web app inspired by [op.gg](https://op.gg), and aims to accomplish the same if not more towards Valorant.
Valorank is made with [Vue.Js](https://vuejs.org/) as the frontend.
Although we are not associated with Riot Games Valorank uses apis provided by Riot.
We are independent developers passionated about the game and the community, feel free to reach out.

Our goals are:
- To bring statistics to the player for them to reflect on their performance
- To give the players a way to showcase their achievements
